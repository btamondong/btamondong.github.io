### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite of mine because it was practically the first time I've had to deal with coding with files. It was frustrating to get the hand of it especially with a cancelled lecture, but my partner and I pulled through.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 notably stands out to me because it's the first time I've had to deal with 2D vectors in C++. Having the list of California counties made it interesting for me.

* Lab 11

    I wish I could wait to include lab 12 to see if it would be a favorite, but since I don't have much time, I'll put Lab 11, part 1. This was the first lab where I got to deal with objects and member defining. Spending all my time in the functions file wasa nice change of pace.
